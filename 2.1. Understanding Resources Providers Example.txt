here we'll make a terraform file to create a droplet in digitalocean

you can also follow this link for understanding more

https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/do/index.html

the file extention of terraform is .tf

let the this file name is 'digitalocean.tf'

# Configure the DigitalOcean Provider

provider "digitalocean" {
  token = "your_token"
}

# Create a web server
resource "digitalocean_droplet" "web" {
  region = "give your region name where you want to create"
  name = "any name you want"
  size = "size of ram"
  image = "image_name"
}

you have to download the plugin for digitalocean in your local mechine.
you can see existing plugin details in '.terraform' folder which is hidden in your current corking directory.

now write down the command, so it will findout automatically which plugin you need to install

1. terraform init

after excuting the 1st command, write 2nd one. this will show you what will happen if you excute your 'digitalocean.tf' file

2. terraform plan

3rd command will excute your 'digitalocean.tf' file

3. terraform apply

it will ask you a value and if you want to excute it, just write 'yes'
after couple of sec check your digitalocean account and you'll find a server created. 

there are two types of argument
1. Required
2. Optional
