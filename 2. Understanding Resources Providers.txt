Terraform has multiple providers

We have to specify the provider details for which we want to launch the infrastructure for.

While specifying the provider, we also have to add the tokens which will be used for authentication.

Example: 
	* AWS Access & Secrect Keys.
	* Digital Ocean Tokens.

You'll get all the provider and their code resources from below link
